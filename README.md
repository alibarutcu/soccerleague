# soccerleague

I created mock REST API (http://my-json-server.typicode.com/alibarutcu/soccerleague/teams1)

You can change the league by changing the value in the “TeamResponse” class.(teams1,teams2 or teams3)

This application support dark mode. If you close the application in dark mode, then the application will open in dark mode. Your mode preferences remain even if you close and open the app.

values-night package(in packages) contains colors.xml and themes.xml for dark mode.

You can find signed and working APK file into app/release.
